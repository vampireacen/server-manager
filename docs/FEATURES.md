# Features Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the key features and capabilities of the Server Management System.

## üéØ Core Features Overview

### 1. Batch Application System (v3.0+)

The system has been redesigned around a batch-based permission request workflow, allowing users to apply for multiple permissions simultaneously.

#### Key Benefits

#### How It Works
1. **User Perspective**: Select a server and multiple permission types in one application
2. **Admin Perspective**: Review the entire batch with individual approval controls for each permission
3. **System Processing**: Each permission in the batch can be individually approved/rejected
4. **Status Tracking**: Overall batch status reflects the state of all contained permissions

#### Batch States
- **Pending**: All permissions awaiting review
- **Processing**: Some permissions reviewed, others pending
- **Completed**: All permissions have been reviewed (approved/rejected)
